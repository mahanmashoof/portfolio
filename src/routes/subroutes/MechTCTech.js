      <p>As part of a test line for photovoltic cell manufacturing, this device was an induction-heated, two-step, vacuum sulfurizing furnace and one of the stations in a CIGS production line. Coated glass would enter this thermal evaporator to react with sulfur under rapid heating (hence induction) and medium vacuum. The image above represents a simple illustration of the furnace and how the glass substrate would enter.</p>

      <h3>My Contribution</h3>
      <p>As an engineer at <a className="text-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tctech.se/">TCTech</a> in 2009, I was responsible for mechanical design, development, and test of this production line station.</p>

          <p><strong>RTP (Rapid Thermal Processing) Oven</strong></p>
          <p>The aim of sulfurization during rapid heating was to minimize process cycle times and still maintain substrate uniformity. It was also considered a promising experiment method to eventually phase out cadmuim from the process.</p>
